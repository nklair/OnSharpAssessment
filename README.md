# OnSharpAssessment
Coding assessment for OnSharp.

The task here was to write a program to calculate the score of a game of ten-pin bowling.

I wrote this in C# using .NET 6.0.

To run, make sure that you have install the latest version of .NET, and then use the command

`dotnet run`

and then enter your bowling scores!
